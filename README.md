# NewVM Terraform Provider

_This repository is built on the [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework). The repository built on the [Terraform Plugin SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk) can be found at [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding). See [Which SDK Should I Use?](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework-benefits) in the Terraform documentation for additional information._

This repository is a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider. It creates a Terraform provider, containing:

- A resource and a data source (`internal/provider/`),
- Examples (`examples/`) and documentation (`docs/`),
- Miscellaneous meta files.

These files contain boilerplate code that you will need to edit to create your own Terraform provider. Tutorials for creating Terraform providers can be found on the [HashiCorp Developer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework) platform. _Terraform Plugin Framework specific guides are titled accordingly._

Please see the [GitHub template repository documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for how to create a new repository from this template on GitHub.

Once you've written your provider, you'll want to [publish it on the Terraform Registry](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers/publishing) so that others can use it.
